interview-nrao
=====================
I had an interview with the [NRAO](http://www.nrao.edu/) (National Radio Astronomy Observatory) for a *Software Engineer II* position, and was given a coding exercise to calculate the amount of time spent performing astronomical observations. This exercise was written in [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)), and emphasized to be [object oriented](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_programming).

###Definition

Azimuth: is the angular distance along the horizon to the location of the object.  By convention, *azimuth* is measured from north towards the east along the horizon.

Elevation: sometimes called *altitude*, is the distance of an object appears to be above the horizon.  The angle is measured up from the closest point on the horizon.

Flux density:  is a non-[SI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SI) unit (jansky, or Jy) of spectral [flux density](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flux_density).  One jansky is equivalent to  10^(-26) [watts](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watt) per [square metre](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Square_metre) per [hertz](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hertz).  It was created for and is still most frequently used in reference to electromagnetic energy, especially in the context of radio astronomy.  The brightest [astronomical radio sources](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_radio_source) have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred janskys.

**Note:** The Sun *at 10 GHz* has *4,000,000* Jansky (JY).

###Overview

##Configuration

###GIT
Fork this project in your GitHub account, then clone your repository:

```
cd /var/www/html/
sudo git clone https://[YOUR-USERNAME]@github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/interview-nrao.git interview-nrao
```

Then, add the Remote Upstream, this way we can pull any merged pull-requests:

```
cd /var/www/html/interview-nrao/
git remote add upstream https://github.com/[YOUR-USERNAME]/interview-nrao.git
```

###File Permission
Change the file permission for the entire project by issuing the command:

```
cd /var/www/html/
sudo chown -R jeffrey:sudo interview-nrao
```

**Note:** change 'jeffrey' to the user account YOU use.

##Execution

This repository / exercise contains `scanner.py`, which is responsible for running the necessary *validation*, and *calculation* scripts, contained within the `lib/` subdirectory.

To calculate the amount of time spent performing an astronomical observations:

```
cd /var/www/html/interview-nrao
python scanner.py input.txt
```
